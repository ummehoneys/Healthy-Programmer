# Healthy-Programmer

Healthy Programmer. A program we coders definitely require. 

Assuming  that a programmer works at the office from 9-5 pm. We have to take care of his health and remind him three things,

To drink a total of 3.5-liter water after some time interval between 9-5 pm.
To do eye exercise after every 30 minutes.
To perform physical activity after every 45 minutes.
